There are different ideas about pets in different parts of the world. In most cultures, animals are in a worse position than human beings. In some cases, however, people treat their pets like members of their families, or perhaps better. In the United States and Europe, there are special shops that sell clothing and food for cats and dogs.
In many countries of the world, there is special food for pets. It is common for big markets in many places to sell cat food and dog food. However, in a small town in France, there is a special restaurant for dogs. Dogs are the only customers. There is seating for twenty of them. The dogs choose from a variety of dishes on the menu.
Of course, in most parts of the world, pets don't live in such wealth and comfort. People treat their pets in a more practical way. People own cats and dogs because they keep away mice and other unwanted animals. Owners have some loving feelings for their pets, but they do not see them as equal to family members. In most places in the world, there isn't any special clothing or fine food for animals. There aren't any special restaurants for dogs.
Pets around the world live in a great variety of ways, just as people do.
